This repository contains the example files (in Julia) that were used to compare the ability of Diagonally Dominant Sums of Squares (DSOS) polynomials to replace Sums of Squares (SOS) polynomials within a certain problem class: Stability Number Calculation. Mostly written in Julia, this contains multiple notebooks outlining our examples.
